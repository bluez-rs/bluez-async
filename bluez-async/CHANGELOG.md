# Changelog

## 0.8.1

### New features

- Added `pair_with_timeout` and `cancel_pairing` to `BluetoothSession`.

## 0.8.0

### Breaking changes

- Added `mtu` to `CharacteristicInfo`.

### New features

- Implemented `TryFrom<&[String]>` for `CharacteristicFlags`.

## 0.7.2

### Bugfixes

- Default `DeviceInfo.bonded` to false if it is not set rather than returning an error. It was only
  added in BlueZ 5.65 so earlier versions will omit it, which resulted in devices being dropped
  entirely.

## 0.7.1

### Bugfixes

- Default `DeviceInfo.wake_allowed` to false if it is not set rather than returning an error. It
  appears not to be set in some cases, possibly depending on controller hardware, which was
  resulting in no devices being discovered.

## 0.7.0

### Breaking changes

- Added more fields to `DeviceInfo`.

## 0.6.0

### Breaking changes

- Updated `uuid` dependency to 1.1.2.

## 0.5.5

### New features

- Implemented `serde` `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits for `AdapterId`, `DeviceId`, `ServiceId`,
  `CharacteristicId` and `DescriptorId`.

## 0.5.4

### New features

- Added `BluetoothSession::adapter_event_stream` method.

## 0.5.3

### Bugfixes

- Fixed `start_discovery` and `start_discovery_with_filter` to log errors rather than printing them
  to stdout.

## 0.5.2

### Bugfixes

- Fixed `tokio` dependency to include `rt` feature.

## 0.5.1

### Bugfixes

- Fixed bug with `authenticated-signed-writes` characteristic flag not being recognised due to typo.

## 0.5.0

### Breaking changes

- Added modalias to `AdapterInfo`.

### New features

- Added `BluetoothSession::connect_with_timeout` method.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed bug where if there were multiple event streams, only one would get each event.

## 0.4.0

### Breaking changes

- More helpful errors for parsing `MacAddress`.
- Acronyms no longer upper-case.

### New features

- `MacAddress` is now `Copy`, and can be formatted in upper or lower case.
- `MacAddress` can be converted to and from a byte array.

### Other changes

- Moved out of the mijia-homie repository to a new separate repository.

## 0.3.1

### New features

- Added new `DeviceEvent` variants for service data and service list updates.

## 0.3.0

### Breaking changes

- `BluetoothSession::get_adapters()` now returns `AdapterInfo`s rather than `AdapterId`s.

### New features

- Added `AdapterInfo` struct with information about the status of a Bluetooth adapter, and methods
  to get it for all adapters on the system or a specific adapter.

## 0.2.1

### New features

- Added TX power and address type to `DeviceInfo`.
- Added methods for using a specific adapter rather than all adapters on the system.
- Added support for reading and writing characteristics and descriptors from a given offset, and
  explicitly specifying what type of write operation to use.

### Other changes

- Wait for service discovery to complete before returning from `connect`. This should avoid errors
  when trying to look up services on a device immediately after connecting to it.

## 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

- Added new `DeviceEvent` variant for manufacturer-specific data updates.

### New features

- Added method to stop discovery.
- Added method to set discovery filters when starting discovery.
- Added manufacturer-specific data to `DeviceInfo`.

### Other changes

- Added example to log readings from RuuviTag sensors.

## 0.1.1

### New features

- Added more properties to `DeviceInfo`, including service UUIDs.

### Other changes

- Added more documentation.
- Added example to list all devices.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.
